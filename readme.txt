Our team members fulfill one of four roles: Image Processing Engineers (IPE), Data Engineers (DE), Deep Learning Engineers (DLE), and Integration Engineers (IE). To join the Perception team please prepare to do at least two of the following tasks (if youâ€™re interested in a particular role, please attempt at least one task related to that role).

We will meet on Wednesday (9/6) from 6-8 pm in Dreese 266 to release the data/specifics for each task. Please come prepared to use your code (which can be prewritten) for our challenge. If you are unable to make it or have any questions please let us know. This is meant to be an easy way to show off your perception skills:)

Tasks:
1. Use a classical computer vision approach (no deep learning models) to find traffic lights in a photo, determine the traffic light status (IPE)
2. Use a deep learning model to find all cars, pedestrians, and animals in a 2d image (DLE)
3. Take noisy binary lane segmentation results and refine them to be more clear (IPE) (DE)
4. Determine which lane each car is in (IPE) (DE)
5. Create an oriented bounding box that is level with the ground (IPE) (DE)
6. Reformat KITTI labels to COCO labels (DE)
7. Open a Docker container, create a ROS2 foxy data publisher and subscriber (IE)
8. Visualize a KITTI point cloud (DE) (DLE) (IE)

Requirements:
Must use Python. Approved packages: OpenCV, scikit-image, PyTorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, open3d, plotly.
For tasks 1-6 visualization is helpful and/or required to demonstrate the approach and/or results.
Deep learning models are only accepted for task 2, if you use a deep learning model for any other tasks, the response will not be considered.
Short type-up in notes.txt to discuss approach, solution, and difficulties for each task. If unable to complete one of the problems, explain what was completed, what approaches were tried, and what you would do differently.
The code should be readable (this includes variable names and comments when needed).
Please have your code setup to write the results and visualizations into the results directory under each task when appropriate to do so

How you will be accessed:
We will look at your results, code, and notes.txt files under each task to see what work you did and how you approached the problem.
We will run your code for each task.
Typically, if it is easy to understand what you did, you're on the right track (this applies to code and how you choose to communicate your results)

Notes:
Why the lack of using 'AI' models? - The majority of our work is not related to using the model directly, rather pre and post processing work and performing analysis on results. Our tasks reflect typical tasks we do
What format should we use for our results? - Clearly display your results in a way that shows you completed the task. If you think you've sufficiently shown you results and communicated your approach, you should be good to go.

Submission:
