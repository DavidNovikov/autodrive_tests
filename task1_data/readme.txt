Use a classical computer vision approach (no deep learning models) to 
-find traffic lights in img0.png, img1.png, img2.png, img3.png, and img4.png
-determine the traffic light status (red, yellow, green, none)
-display a bounding box around the traffic light to indicate its position and display text to indicate predicted status (example shown in sample_results.png)
-use train_img1.png and train_img2.png as samples/references for how we typically expect traffic lights to look (perhaps it is not necessary)
