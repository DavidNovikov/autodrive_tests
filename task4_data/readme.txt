Determine which lane each car is in
-this task has no code required, however if you wrote any code we are highly interested in seeing it
-for this question, please write a pseudocode algorithm for determining which lane a car is in, assume you have a 3d point cloud, 2d object detection results, and a camera calibration matrix to go from the 3d point cloud to the 2d image.
-don't forget to discuss potential edge cases and describe your method
